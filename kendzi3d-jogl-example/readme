*** How to run

To run the jar you need to have correct dependencies in the classpath.  The following bash snippet will attempt
to find the correct jars in the locations listed below and put them into classpath variable CP.

JAR_DIR=/usr/share/java        # folder with vecmath*.jar and log4j*.jar
JOGL_DIR=~/.josm/plugins/jogl  # folder with jogl-all*.jar and gluegen-rt*.jar
JOGL_VER=2.3.2                 # jogl version installed in ${JOGL_DIR}
KENDZI_PROJ=~/workspace        # (top-level-dir) of {..}/kendzi-math-geometry/{..}/kendzi-math-geometry*.jar and alike 

for dep in vecmath log4j-1.2 {jogl-all,gluegen-rt}-${JOGL_VER} kendzi{-math-geometry,3d-jogl-{util,example}}
do
   find "${KENDZI_PROJ}" -ipath "*/${dep}/*/${dep}*jar" | grep '.' || \
   find "${JAR_DIR}" "${JOGL_DIR}" -ipath "*${dep}*jar"
done \
| sort | tee /dev/stderr | paste -s -d ':' | \
while read CP
do
   java -cp "$CP" kendzi.jogl.ui.BaseJoglFrame
done

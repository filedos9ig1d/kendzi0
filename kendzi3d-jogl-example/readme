
This project provide buildings builder.

*** How to build

Now you can build this project using command 
maven install


*** How to run (outside an IDE)

To run the jar you need to have correct dependencies in the classpath.  The following bash snippet will attempt
to find the correct jars in the locations listed below and put them into classpath variable CP.

#M2="$HOME/.m2/repository"           # local maven repo, uncomment if you used 'maven install' to populate it
                                     #                   in this case directories below will not be searched
JAR_DIR="/usr/share/java"            # folder with vecmath*.jar and log4j*.jar
JOGL_DIR="$HOME/.josm/plugins/jogl"  # folder with jogl-all*.jar and gluegen-rt*.jar
KENDZI_PROJ="$HOME/workspace"        # (top-level-dir) of kendzi-*.jar snapshot builds

JOGL_VER=2.3
for DEP in vecmath log4j-[0-9] {jogl-all,gluegen-rt}-${JOGL_VER} kendzi{-math-geometry-[0-9],3d-jogl-{util,example}}
do
   find ${M2:-"$JAR_DIR" "$JOGL_DIR" "$KENDZI_PROJ"} -iname "${DEP}*jar" \
      -not -iname "*native*" -not -iname "*sources*" | sort | tail -1 | \
   while read JAR
   do
      echo $JAR
      JAR="${JAR##*/}"
      find ${M2:-"$JAR_DIR" "$JOGL_DIR" "$KENDZI_PROJ"} -iname "${JAR//.jar/*native*jar}"
   done
done \
| sort | tee /dev/stderr | paste -s -d ':' | \
while read CP
do
   java -cp "$CP" kendzi.jogl.ui.BaseJoglFrame
done

*** How to build

this plug-in is managed by maven. But it depend on projects: JOSM, kendzi3d, which are managed by ant. So at start you need to build them using ant commands. Run on both projects:

ant build

Build output should be in directory: 
JOSM/dist/josm-custom.jar
JOSM/dist/kendzi3d.jar

Now you need to install this files into local maven repository using maven install command or using eclipse launch:
/launch/maven install JOSM (maven-repo).launch
/launch/maven install kendzi3d.core (maven-repo).launch


Now you can build this project using command 
maven install
